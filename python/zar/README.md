# Zarpy: formally verified biased coin and n-sided die.

`import zarpy` to use the package.

See the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06747) (to appear in
PLDI'23) and [Github repository](https://github.com/bagnalla/zar).

## Why use Zarpy?

### Probabilistic choice

A common operation in randomized algorithms is *probabilistic choice*:
for some `p ∈ [0,1]`, execute action `a1` with probability `p` or `a2`
with probability `1-p` (i.e., flip a biased coin to determine the path
of execution). A quick-and-dirty method for performing probabilistic
choice is as follows:

```python
if random() < p:
  execute a1
else:
  execute a2
```

where `p` is a float in the range `[0,1]` and `random()` produces a
random float in the range `[0,1)`. While good enough for many
applications, this approach is not always correct due to float
roundoff error. We can only expect `a1` to execute with probability `p + ϵ`
for some small error term ϵ, technically invalidating any
correctness guarantees of our overall system that depend on the
correctness of its probabilistic choices.

Zarpy provides an alternative that is guaranteed (by formal proof in
Coq) to execute `a1` with probability exactly equal to `p` (where `n`
and `d` are integers such that `p = n/d`):

```python
from zarpy import build_coin, flip
build_coin((n, d)) # Build and cache coin with bias p = n/d
if flip(): # Generate a Boolean value with Pr(True) = p 
  execute a1
else:
  execute a2
```

### Uniform sampling

Another common operation is randomly drawing from a finite collection
of values with equal (uniform) probabilities. An old trick for drawing
an integer uniformly from the range `[0, n)` is to generate a random
integer from `[0, RAND_MAX]` and take the modulus wrt. `n`:

```python
x = rand() % n # Assign x random value from [0,n)
```

but this method suffers from modulo bias when `n` is not a power of 2,
causing some values to occur with higher probability than others (see,
e.g., [this
article](https://research.kudelskisecurity.com/2020/07/28/the-definitive-guide-to-modulo-bias-and-how-to-avoid-it/)
for more information on modulo bias). Zarpy provides a uniform sampler
that is guaranteed for any integer `0 < n` to generate samples from
`[0,n)` with probability `1/n` of each:

```python
from zarpy import build_die, roll
build_die(n)
x = roll()
```

Although the python function `random.randint` is ostensibly free from
modulo bias, our implementation provides a *formal proof of
correctness*.

The samplers provided by Zarpy have been implemented and verified in
Coq and extracted to OCaml and bundled into Python package via
pythonlib. Validity of the correctness proofs is thus dependent on
correctness of Coq's extraction mechanism, a small amount of OCaml
shim code (viewable
[here](https://github.com/bagnalla/zar/blob/main/python/zar/ocaml/zarpy.ml)),
and the pythonlib library.

## Proofs of correctness

The coin and die samplers are implemented as probabilistic programs
and compiled to [interaction
trees](https://github.com/DeepSpec/InteractionTrees) by the
[Zar](https://github.com/bagnalla/zar) probabilistic programming
system. See the file
[zarpy.v](https://github.com/bagnalla/zar/blob/main/zarpy.v) for their
implementations and proofs of correctness.

Correctness is two-fold. For biased coin with bias `p`, we prove:

*
  [coin_itree_correct](https://github.com/bagnalla/zar/blob/main/zarpy.v#L57):
  the probability of `true` according to the formal probabilistic
  semantics of the constructed interaction tree is equal to `p`, and

*
  [coin_samples_equidistributed](https://github.com/bagnalla/zar/blob/main/zarpy.v#L75):
  when the source of random bits is uniformly distributed, for any
  sequence of coin flips the proportion of `true` samples converges to
  `p` as the number of samples goes to +∞.

The equidistribution result is dependent on uniform distribution of
the Boolean values generated by OCaml's
[`Random.bool`](https://v2.ocaml.org/api/Random.html) function. See
[the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06747) for a more detailed
explanation.

Similarly, the theorem
[die_itree_correct](https://github.com/bagnalla/zar/blob/main/zarpy.v#L136)
proves semantic correctness of the n-sided die, and
[die_samples_equidistributed](https://github.com/bagnalla/zar/blob/main/zarpy.v#L161)
equidistribution of its samples.

## Usage

`seed()` initializes the PRNG.

### Biased coin

`build_coin((num, denom))` builds and caches a coin with `Pr(True) =
num/denom` for nonnegative integer `num` and positive integer `denom`.

`flip()` produces a single Boolean sample by flipping the cached coin.

`flip_n(n)` produces `n` Boolean samples by flipping the cached coin.

### N-sided die

`build_die(n)` builds and caches an n-sided die with `Pr(m) = 1/n` for
integer `m` where `0 <= m < n`.

`roll()` produces a single sample by rolling the cached die.

`roll_n(n)` produces `n` integer samples by rolling the cached die.
